GBM_expression_data.csv: master data set
Age Group I: patients from age 35-65
Age Group II: patients from age 66-85
Age Group I t-tests: Jupyter notebook showing the code used to determine statistical significance of differences between gene expression in long-term and short-term survivors in Group I
Age Group II t-tests: Jupyter notebook showing the code used to determine statistical significance of differences between gene expression in long-term and short-term survivors in Group II
  - Conclusions: In *both* age group I and II, these 8 genes were differentially expressed between long- and short-term survivors:
      - MARCH8
      - FBXO17
      - TFRC
      - NSUN5
      - MT1M
      - RPRM
      - ACOX2
      - HOMER1
GBM_data_for_clustering.csv: CSV file containing only the expression levels for the 8 differentially-expressed genes to be used for clustering
Hierarchical Clustering Analysis: Jupyter notebook containing the code used to create a dendrogram and cluster map that can be used to determine the number of clusters, and which samples are in each cluster.
  - Conclusions: There are 2 distinct clusters representing 2 groups of patients with distinct gene expression profiles, which can now be used to conduct Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of both groups. 
  
Next Steps: (1) Kaplan-Meier analysis of the two clusters 
            (2) Logistic regression (?)
            (3) Multivariate analysis (?)
